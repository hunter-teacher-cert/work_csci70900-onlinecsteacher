Objective:
The student will be able to…
- Understand that a variable stores a single number (int)
- Trace how the variable’s value changes when different methods are applied

Target Student Audience:
The target student audience for this lesson would be 8th grade students who are already familiar with drag-and-drop coding, e.g. Scratch, and are now switching to text based programming in Java. These students will have already seen variables, functions, while statements, and loops but may not have experience writing them in code yet. They can however trace out code using diagrams to understand how they work.

Pedagogical Techniques:
- Unplugged activities
- Trace tables (with pseudocode)

This lesson is designed to teach students about how variables can store a value and update that value depending on what method is called. By first utilizing an unplugged activity where students act AS the variables and methods, students will get first-hand experience of storing a value (on a whiteboard), calling a method, and updating the stored value.

Then, once students are able to grasp the concept of storing values in variables through the unplugged activity, they will design and trace through their own  table. By the end of the lesson, students should feel comfortable using trace tables on their own. The following day's lesson will require students to use a similar table to trace through code in Java.


Warm Up:
- Word problems using variables

Mini-lesson:
- Unplugged activity with variables

Independent Work Time:
- Diagram (birds eye view of classroom) with methods and variables

Exit Ticket:
- Explain independent work diagram (of Unplugged activity)
