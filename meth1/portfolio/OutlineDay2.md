Outline Day 2
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PkcP6D_CdKQH49U4v9N6yvf-I6puCNjI-1uBkha-QHk/edit?usp=sharing

Objective:
The student will be able to…
- Understand the difference between methods that take one or two parameters
- Trace (in code) how the variable’s value changes when different methods are applied

Target Student Audience:
The target student audience for this lesson would be 8th grade students who are completing the second part of a lesson on variables and methods. These students have already completed an unplugged activity the day before on tracing through code given a specific variable value and using pen and paper to make a trace table.

Pedagogical Techniques:
- Teacher live coding demo
- Trace tables (with Java code)

The teacher will demonstrate coding the methods for oneParameter(int x) and twoParameters(int x, int y) so that students understand how the code in Java gets written even if they aren't yet at the level where they could write the code on their own.

Then, the teacher will walk students through how to fill out a trace table (similar to the ones from the previous lesson) for walking through the code in Java (LessonPlan2_code.java). Students will have a chance to watch the teacher demonstrate while writing in their own notebooks, then in pairs will work on completing the remaining trace tables.

Warm Up:
- Students solve each other’s trace tables from previous lesson

Mini-lesson:
- Teacher demo of code tracing (one parameter, then two)

Independent Work Time:
- Pair programming to trace through code with variables and methods

Exit Ticket:
- Completed trace tables
