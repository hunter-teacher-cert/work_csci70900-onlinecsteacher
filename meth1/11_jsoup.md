How do we get students to set up Jsoup?

TEAM: EMMA. ALEX, EDUARDO, MR.H, MARINA

Warm Up: Research online about jsoup and what it is used for. Find any feature your personally would be interested to use?
- Discussion of real world applications, e.g. words appearing in different headlines, web scraping of different Twitter accounts, etc.

If students each have their own device:
- Download Jsoup/jar file and upload it into the same directory as their java file
- Step-by-step walkthrough of how to download Jsoup
- During step-by-step walkthrough, have 2-3 students circulating in the classroom troubleshooting.
Students might be provided with a short teacher-recorded video instructions for downloading jsoup and a short example of use.
What activity would we have students do using Jsoup?

I do - You do - We do
- Teacher demonstrates how to use Jsoup for web scraping, e.g. What websites are interesting? What information is useful to gather? Starter code? Or code Examples?

Student Work Time
- In pairs or small groups students work through different questions on a worksheet, e.g. What are the top headlines from NYTimes today? What pages are featured on Wikipedia's homepage? On your school website?
- Graphic organizer?  Sentence starters?  Ideas and examples? Vocabulary list?
- Quick share-out?  Two students share?

Deliverables
- Jsoup installed on device
- Use and understand different command line prompts for Jsoup
- Completed worksheet with answers
- Extension: design and complete a creative project using Jsoup
